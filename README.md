## Step 1
`git clone <repository-url>`

Use the git clone command to clone the repository to your local machine. Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL of this repository.

Open up a terminal window and make sure you switch to the directory which encompasses the project you just cloned using the cd command.

## Step 3
`cd server`

<br>
## Step 4
`cd ..`
<br>
`cd client`
